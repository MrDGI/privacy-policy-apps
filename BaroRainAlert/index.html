<h1>Privacy Policy – BaroRainAlert</h1>

<p>Last updated: 2025</p>

<h2>1. General Information</h2>
<p>
BaroRainAlert is a Wear OS application that analyzes atmospheric pressure changes on the device to estimate the likelihood of rain. 
The app is designed to operate entirely on the device and does not collect any personal user data.
</p>

<h2>2. Data Collected by the Application</h2>
<p>
BaroRainAlert exclusively uses the device’s <strong>barometric sensor</strong> to obtain atmospheric pressure values.  
This data:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Is not stored outside the device.</li>
    <li>Is not sent to external servers.</li>
    <li>Is not shared with third parties.</li>
    <li>Is not associated with any personal identity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Permissions Used</h2>
<p>
The application may require access to the device’s barometric sensor.  
This permission is necessary for the app’s core functionality and does not involve access to personal data.
</p>

<h2>4. Use of Data</h2>
<p>
Atmospheric pressure values are used solely for:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Calculating barometric trends.</li>
    <li>Generating local rain alerts.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All information is processed locally on the watch.
</p>

<h2>5. Third‑Party Services</h2>
<p>
BaroRainAlert does not use third‑party services, does not include advertising, and does not employ analytics tools.
</p>

<h2>6. Security</h2>
<p>
Since the application does not collect or transmit personal data, the risk of information exposure is minimal. 
Nevertheless, recommended secure development practices for Wear OS are followed.
</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
This privacy policy may be updated occasionally.  
Any modifications will be published on this same page.
</p>

<h2>8. Contact</h2>
<p>
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you can contact the developer through the app’s Google Play page.
